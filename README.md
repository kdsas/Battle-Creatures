Battle Creatures is a multiplayer 2D top-down strategy game where in HOST/JOIN mode, whether player one or player two, the game host must shoot first. Make sure firewall is turned off on your device before starting gameplay. If the player's health is equal to 90 after the 3-minute gameplay interval, they will win the game. If the player's deaths and kills are equal to 3 or more, they will lose the game. In ONLINE mode, you win the game if your kills are over 5 and your health is over 65. In ONLINE mode, you lose the game if your health is under or equal to 50.
