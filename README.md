Battle Creatures is a multiplayer 2D top-down strategy game where in LAN mode, the player must destroy the opposing playerâ€™s entire AI army within ten minutes by shooting ammo. In LAN mode, the player can purchase a wisdom potion or gem from the in-game store to power up and the player can only level up if they don't lose any health points at all at their current level, there are 4 levels. In both Internet and LAN modes, if the player loses all of their health points, they have to restart the game.
